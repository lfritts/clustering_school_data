  <h1>Our Goal</h1>
  <p class="lead">Schools are currently being graded on the Washington State Assessment in reading, writing, math, and science at both the state and federal level.  Each year, the state provides the data to districts and schools from the previous year.  This data compares the last year's data with previous years and determines an adequate yearly progress goal for the current year.</p>
  <p class="lead">A problem that faces a school is understanding why progress is not being made at a rate that matches or exceeds the adequate yearly progress.  Each year some schools continue to far exceed their adequate yearly progress goals while others founder.  Some years a school may go from not making adequate yearly progress to far exceeding it or vice-versa.</p>
  <p class="lead">A comparison of schools based on demographics may help struggling schools identify similar schools with better performance.</p>
